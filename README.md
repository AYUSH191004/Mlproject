## Introduction
Diamond pricing is a complex task influenced by several factors including carat, cut, clarity, and color. This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features related to diamond characteristics:
- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut, categorized into 5 levels (Fair, Good, Very Good, Ideal, Premium).
- **Clarity**: Internal purity of the diamond, categorized into 8 levels (I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF).
- **Color**: Rated from D to J, with D being the most colorless and J being the most yellow.
- **Price**: Target variable representing the price of the diamond.

The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunnysavita10/Gemstone-Price-Prediction-End-to-End/main/NOTES/data/gemstone.csv).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and duplicates.
- **Categorical Data Exploration**: Analyzing distributions of categorical variables like cut, color, and clarity.
- **Numerical Data Exploration**: Analyzing distributions of numerical variables like carat and price.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating correlations between features.

Detailed analysis can be found in the `EDA.ipynb` notebook.

## Model Training
The model training process includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Imputation, encoding, and scaling of features.
- **Model Selection**: Various regression models are trained, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Decision Trees.
- **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on performance metrics like RMSE and R².

Detailed code for model training is available in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.

## Results
